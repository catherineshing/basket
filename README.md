To-Do Items / Known Issues
--------------------------

+ Lists Summary Page
 + Prevent special characters in list title input
 + Hitting 'Enter' should save the new list item

+ Lists Detail Page
 + 'Esc' key only dismisses modals the first time
 + Alert not centered for xs/xl screens
 + Sending a list via email is not actually enabled (of course)
 + Add email input validation
 + Email input autofocus only works the first time
 + Delete/Save Item buttons don't align well in IE8-9
 + User modal is shared across lists (Too much typing! You get the idea :) )
 + Add ability to add users to modal
 + Hitting 'Enter' should save the list title during list title edit
 + Tab to 'delete' & 'save' during edit item
 + The `<hr/>` elements throw off the clickable area (i.e. If you click slightly below the `<hr/>` in the next row, you will be prompted to edit the previous row)
